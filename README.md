### Computational Thinking with Algorithm

#### Author: Alexander Pepe

#### Lecturer: Dr. Dominic Carr

This project is part of the Computational Thinking with Algorithms module and consists of an application in Python with seven different sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, heap sort, bucket sort, counting sort, shell sort and pancake sort. This application uses the Python "time" library to measure the running time generated using arrays of randomly generated integers, thus building the Benchmark. The project was divided into introduction, definition of sorting algorithm, implementation and benchmarking and conclusion.
